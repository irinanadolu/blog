		<p>Besides the team of technical writers who have full write access to the documentation
			repositories, there may be other collaborators (e.g. subject matter experts) who have
			read access to the repository and sometimes want to propose changes.</p>
		<p>The workflow for proposing changes to a repository usually works like this:<ol
				id="ol_jl2_k2w_v2c">
				<li><b>Identify the Need for a Change</b><p>The SME (subject matter expert) starts
						by reading the published output and thinking about what to change</p></li>
				<li><b>Click “Edit Online”</b><p>They click on an "Edit online" link on the page
						they want to change</p></li>
			<li><b>Make the Edits</b><p>Using the <xref
							href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_web_author.html" format="html"
							scope="external">Oxygen XML Web Author</xref> the SME can make changes
						directly to the DITA topic—no need to download or clone the
					repository.</p></li>
		<li><b>Submit the Changes</b><p>When they try to commit, Web Author automatically
						creates a pull request with their changes</p></li>
		<li><b>Review and Merge</b><p>The technical writer reviews the change, improve the
						content if needed, and merges the pull request.</p></li>
			</ol></p>
		<p>You can see this workflow presented in detail in the video below. Short on time? Jump straight
			to the <xref href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzQ0XhmtPUI&amp;t=217s" format="html"
				scope="external">demo section</xref> and see it in action. </p>
