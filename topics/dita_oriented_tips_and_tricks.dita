    <p><ph keyref="oxygen"/> has about 18 years of development under its wings. During these
      years, we added lots of functionality and many of our users usually do not know more than 20-30%
      of Oxygen's features. So this presentation is intended for technical writers using Oxygen to
      write DITA content and who may want to find out more about their tool.</p>
    <section id="section_gld_tbs_gfb">
      <title>Add-ons</title>
      <p>There are lots of free add-ons provided by the Oxygen team that can be installed in an

        the most interesting one:</p>
      <ul id="ul_xbw_ccs_gfb">
        <li>Git add-on. This plugin adds a side view allowing you to do some
          common Git operations like pull, commit, push (mostly 90% of what a regular Git user would
          do).</li>
        <li><xref href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-addons/topics/content-fusion-addon.html"
            format="html" scope="external">Content Fusion Connector add-on</xref>. Collaborate with
          your peers by sending them links that allow them to give you feedback on your work using a
          web browser without the need to pre-install anything on their side. </li>

            href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-addons/topics/translation-package-builder-addon.html"
            format="html" scope="external">Translation package builder</xref>. Small plugin that can
          be used to prepare a zip file containing only the topics that have changed from one
          version to another.</li>

      <title>Project-related Functionality:</title>
      <p>The Oxygen Project view is the place where you can organize and apply batch changes to all
        your DITA resources:</p>

            format="html" scope="external">Main files support</xref>. Enable main files support
          in the DITA project, add your top level DITA Maps as main files and any structure
          changes, renaming or moving files will automatically update all links in the DITA Project.
          Also works for renaming/moving image resources.</li>

            format="html" scope="external">Store options at project level.</xref> Almost all of
          Oxygen's preferences pages can be saved at project level. Once you do that, you can share
          the <b>project.xpr</b> file with somebody else and when they open it, they will also get
          the settings set inside the project.</li>
        <li>Compare files/folders.</li>
        <li>Refer to multiple folders.</li>

          and use the "Transform", "Validate", "Format and Indent", "Find/Replace in Files", or

      <title>Tools</title>
      <p>The <b>Tools</b> main menu is worth exploring sometimes. You can invoke XML refactoring
        actions from it or open other small applications like the SVG viewer.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="section_fdt_dk3_ffb">
      <title>Import</title>
      <p>The <b>File</b> menu offers the possibility to import HTML, CSV, Excel files, or database
        content as XML.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="section_gdt_dk3_ffb">
      <title>Other Views and Toolbars:</title>
      <p>You can right-click in the toolbar area and use the <b>Configure Toolbars</b> action to see
        what toolbars are available or what toolbars can be removed.</p>
      <p>The <b>Symbols</b> toolbar is quite interesting if you often want to insert symbols that
        are not on the current keyboard.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="section_hdt_dk3_ffb">
      <title>Other Small Tips:</title>
      <p>The main <b>Window</b> menu has actions to tile all opened XML documents and also to enable
        synchronous scrolling in them (useful if you want to look at similar XML documents and maybe
        to copy/paste between them).</p>

      <title>Keeping in Touch</title>
      <p>Oxygen's <b>Help</b> menu allows you to use the <b>Report problem</b> action to contact us
        directly. The <b>Support Tools->Randomize XML Content</b> action allows you to randomize the
        content of an XML project before sending it to us for tests.</p>
      <p>And there are a lot of other ways to get in touch with us or to find various videos or
        tutorials to read: <xref href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/technical_support.html"
