        <p>We have developed AI-based tools that we believe will greatly benefit technical
            documentation writers. These tools are designed to enhance the editing experience and
            provide AI-powered assistance for published documentation.</p>
        <p><b>George Bina</b> has created a presentation titled '<b>AI-Powered XML Editing</b>',
            which offers a comprehensive overview of the key AI-related features we've implemented
            in our application over recent years. I've included this presentation below for our
            clients and integrators to gain a better understanding of the <b>AI-Powered XML
                Editing</b> tools we offer.</p>
