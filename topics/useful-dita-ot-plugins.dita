        <p>The <b>DITA Open Toolkit</b> is the most commonly used engine for publishing <b>DITA</b>
      content to various output formats. It has a plugin-based architecture and it comes bundled by
      default with plugins for publishing to <b>XHTML</b>-based and <b>PDF</b> formats. There are
      other useful open-source plugins that can be installed in the <b>DITA Open Toolkit</b> and
      provide various publishing or reporting capabilities. Below is a list of my favorite open
      source plugins, many of which are bundled by default with <b><ph keyref="oxygen"/></b>:</p>
        <section id="section_f2h_qsc_2z">
            <title>DITA to MS Word</title>
            <p>This very useful plugin developed by Jarno Elovirta (the main DITA OT developer) can
        be used to publish <b>DITA</b> to <b>MS Word (OOXML)</b>: <xref
          href="https://github.com/jelovirt/com.elovirta.ooxml" format="ooxml" scope="external"/>.
        The plugin is robust and can handle large DITA projects.</p>

        output and generate <b>Kindle</b> or <b>Mobi</b> formats.</p>

            <title>Use Markdown content directly in DITA Maps</title>
            <p>This plugin developed by Jarno Elovirta can be used to publish hybrid DITA projects
        containing both DITA and Markdown topics to any output format: <xref

            <title>Embed video and audio resources in DITA topics</title>
            <p>This handy little plugin developed by <b>Oxygen</b> allows you to embed audio, video,
        or YouTube resources in <b>DITA</b> topics and properly display the embedded content in the
        XHTML-based outputs: <xref href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/dita-media-support"

            <title>Publish RelaxNG-based DITA topics</title>
            <p><b>RelaxNG</b> is the default schema type in which the <b>DITA</b> vocabulary is
                described by the specification developers. But the <b>DITA Open Toolkit</b> does not
                allow publishing RNG-based <b>DITA</b> content by default. Installing this plugin
                developed by <b>Oxygen</b> will make this possible: <xref

            <p>This useful plugin developed by <b>Oxygen</b> allows you to preserve <b>Oxygen</b>
                change tracking highlights in the PDF output: <xref

            <title>Publish DITA to PDF using CSS</title>
            <p>The difficult thing about the default PDF output is the customization that involves
        modifying XSLT scripts and requiring knowledge of both <b>XSLT</b> and <b>XSL-FO</b>. This
        plugin developed by <b>Oxygen</b> allows you to use <b>CSS</b> to customize the <b>PDF</b>
        obtained from <b>DITA</b> content: <xref href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/dita-css"
          format="html" scope="external"/>. The plugin needs a commercial license of <b>RenderX
          XEP</b> or <b>Antenna House</b> in order to produce the PDF: <xref
            href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/topics/ditamap-pdf-css-html5-2.html"

        working on a <b>PDF CSS</b> engine (called <b>Chemistry</b>) that will allow the plugin to
        work from <b>Oxygen</b> without any additional licenses: <xref
