            <title>What does Oxygen XML provide as a tool to a technical documentation team?</title>
            <p>Oxygen is a <b>DITA XML</b> desktop editing tool that can be used by technical
                documentation writers to <b>write</b>, <b>reuse</b>, and <b>publish</b> DITA XML
                content to a variety of output formats, such as <b>WebHelp Responsive</b> and
                    <b>PDF</b>.</p>

            <title>To which companies would you recommend a DITA XML based solution for writing
                technical documentation?</title>
            <p>I would recommend the use of the DITA XML standard for writing technical
                documentation with Oxygen XML as an editing tool to companies that have one of the
                following conditions fulfilled:<ul id="ul_ef1_wbn_f1c">
                    <li>They have multiple similar products and want to take advantage of DITA XML
                        high reuse capabilities and condition profiling/filters to produce multiple
                        similar, but not identical, manuals from the same project.</li>
                    <li>They want to add structure-based validation rules that must be followed by
                        all members of a team.</li>
                    <li>They want to create their own custom vocabulary of semantic elements.</li>
                    <li>Besides web-based outputs, they also want to produce PDFs and want to have a
                        relatively high degree of control over the PDF customization.</li>

                <li>There are commercial <b>CMSs</b> (content management systems) that have

                    management systems such as <b>Astoria</b>, <b>Bluestream</b>, <b>Componize</b>
                    usually have plugins that allow <b>Oxygen</b> to connect to the <b>CMS</b>
                    remote storage, open documents, edit and save them back. But the price of the
                    commercial content management systems is separate from the price of an

            <p>For example, if you want to create your own publishing customizations, these are
                usually done using CSS. You would have one colleague on your side creating the
                customization and asking us questions along the way. We do not implement full
                customizations for you, but we guide you along the way.</p>
            <p>As for training, we have lots of videos and online resources for learning to use
                Oxygen to produce technical documentation: <xref href="learnDita.dita"/>.</p>
            <p>We can offer you a one-time web meeting to show you how Oxygen works in general, but
                if you want a more rigorous training, we have partners like Ryffine or Mekon who
