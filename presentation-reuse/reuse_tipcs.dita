  <title>Content Reuse Tips and Tricks</title><prolog><author>Radu Coravu</author></prolog>

    <p>I tried to compile below a set of best practices to follow when reusing content:</p>
    <p>
      <image
        href="images/image10.png"
        height="50" id="image_jzc_fnz_15"/>
      <ul id="ul_sv4_gnz_15">
        <li>Keep all your reused content in special topics located in special folders. Technical
          writers need to know that they are editing content which potentially is used in multiple
          contexts.</li>
        <li>Keep a description for each reused element. You can have topics which act like
          dictionaries of reused content. A table of reused content can have two columns. On the
          first column each cell contains the reused element and on the second one you can have a
          small description for each reused element. The description acts as metadata, it may give
          the technical writer more details about how that content should be reused.</li>
        <li> Use <b>conkeyrefs</b> instead of <b>conrefs</b>. Because relative referenced paths used
          in conrefs always break when you move topics around. But more about conkeyrefs in the next
          section.</li>
        <li>When using conkeyrefs you should create a special map with key definitions. This keeps
          the reused content and the keys for it separate from the live content.</li>
      </ul></p>
